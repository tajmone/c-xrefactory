Simple build:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  make dependencies
  make


Development:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, you will need to build a special patched version of Berkeley
yacc, which is stored in byacc-1.9 directory.

c-xref is partially bootstrapped (read more about this in NOTES.md) so
the build will be in two steps (performed automatically):

  - build a c-xref.bs from pre-generated sources if required
  - generate new versions of strFill.g, strTdef.g and enumTxt.g with that
  - build actual c-xref

NOTE: since we want to distribute c-xref in source form, you should
always check that bootstrapping works. (Making incompatible changes to
some structures will break this for example.) Do this with

     make cleaner; make

It should put your directory in a very clean state so that c-xref has
to be bootstrapped.

If you change any grammar files or anything they might depend on you
can run regenerate the parsers (c, java, yacc, cexp) with

   make yacc

which will also generate new parsers.
