Simple build:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  make


Development:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, you will need to build a special patched version of Berkeley
yacc, which is stored in byacc-1.9 directory.

From the src directory you can to development and coverage builds using

  make debug unit test coverage-report

Those should also work with -j (parallel builds).
