In this directory we want to verify

- c-xref server functionality
- elisp c-xref interface
- the C example that's included in distributions

1. setup emacs with c-xrefactory using development version of c-xref (../../src/c-xref)
2. run emacs and apply the refactorings in the example on the example code
3. verify the refactored files

NOTE somehow the tests fail on MacOS because the wrong completion is selected. Don't
know why...

NOTE2 the test is flaky if you are running with coverage because Emacs
will run one c-xref process for the server portion and one for each
refactoring. If you are unlucky or the moon is in the seventh house
coverage code will try to access the .gcda files at the same time
which will cause an error (you have no idea how long it took me to
figure that one out...). Currently we catch that, but then there are
some random temporary directories hanging around which causes the
comparison against the expected file structure and content to
fail. (You could probably remove any directories that are not in the
expected tree, or make diff ignore those extra directories, but for
now it doesn't seem worth it. In any case it happens much less now...
