# Boilerplate Makefile for many c-xref tests

# - Names the test from directory name
# - Generates a specific, simple, c-xrefrc from a template

# In the test Makefiles you just need to include this and define the

# OK and FAIL messages (with colour)

# All tests that uses a edit server driver should use this
EDIT_SERVER_DRIVER = ../../utils/edit_server_driver.py

# If the test requires a .c-xrefrc for test directory you need to
# generate one. The .c-xrefrc requires absolute paths, and to work in
# any directory, a .c-xrefrc can be generated from a common
# c-xrefrc.tpl by replacing some symbols as per rules below.
#
# We use the name '.c-xrefrc' so that a test can set HOME to CWD and
# editors will automatically read the correct file as if it was in the
# users HOME.
#
# TODO: we should check for a c-xrefrc.tpl in the test directory we should use
# that instead, currently they have to do this in the Makefile if the standard
# does not work
