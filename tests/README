These subdirectories contains integration tests for c-xrefactory.

You can "make all", "make quick" or "make slow".

To make a test in a subdirectory to be executed you have to explicitly
include it in the Makefile in the directory. This is so that you
can add partial, or in progress, tests, without the whole test suite
failing.

The Makefiles in the subdirectories usually does some magic with
paths.  c-xref expects full paths, at least in the CX-files and writes
full paths in the output. (We should try to referencing files in the
commands without paths, since they would be in CWD.)

In that magic CURDIR is exchanged with the full path of the current
directory.

NOTE these tests can't be run in parallel, like with 'make -j', probably
because c-xref can't generate temporary files uniquely in parallel.
