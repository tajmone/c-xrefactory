This directory is aimed at starting c-xref & emacs in a sandboxed
session so that it can be monitored, logged and explored.

The goal is to be able to do

    make
    make emacs

or

    make gui

and get a sandboxed emacs in terminal och gui-mode.

1. Create an emacs session with a local complete environment. Since we
use el-get we can just replace the el-get git clone with a link to the
complete c-xrefactory tree (which of course is another git clone of
the repo but one that we do our development in, rather than the
deployed one, which comes with el-get).

DONE.

2. Inject a spy or logger between emacs and an actual c-xref
executable. For the sandboxed Emacs (run using the Makefile) the lisp
variable `c-xref-home-directory` is set to point to the local `bin`
directory. Any `c-xref` here will therefore be used as the one the
c-xrefactory elisp will call. And there is one now that logs the
arguments.

DONE.

3. Log the inter-process communication between the started c-xref
server and Emacs so that we can get closer to the actual goal, namely
to understand and refactor the c-xref protocol.
