In this directory you can start c-xref & emacs in a sandboxed
session so that it can be monitored, logged and explored. Sandboxed
means that the c-xref will guaranteed to be the one in ../../src and
the emacs started will use the c-xref[actory].el in
../../env/emacs. Also the home directory will be set to this directory
so that all c-xref projects and data will be isolated and not interfer
with your private ones.

The interaction will be saved by pipespy into a temporary file called
/tmp/pipespyNNNN.log.

You can do

    make

to start a sandboxed Emacs.

One very handy use of this is that you can start an Emacs using this
and then replay the interaction using the utility
utils/edit_server_driver.

To do that save the /tmp/pipespy*.log file and use that as an input
file for the driver. You just have to

- remove the first three characters on the first line
- remove all the lines with "end-of-options"
- adjust the first line (which is the c-xref invocation command)


Details

Create an emacs session with a local complete environment. Since we
use el-get we can just replace the el-get git clone with a link to the
complete c-xrefactory tree (which of course is another git clone of
the repo but one that we do our development in, rather than the
deployed one, which comes with a real el-get installation. An attempt
has been made to disable el-get-update* to not screw this up.

Inject a spy or logger between emacs and an actual c-xref
executable. For the sandboxed Emacs (run using the Makefile) the lisp
variable `c-xref-home-directory` is set to point to the local `bin`
sub-directory. Any `c-xref` here will therefore be used as the one the
c-xrefactory elisp will call.

TODO Log the inter-process communication between the started c-xref
server and Emacs so that we can get closer to the actual goal, namely
to understand and refactor the c-xref protocol.
