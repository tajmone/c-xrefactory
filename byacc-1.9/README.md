= Yacc for C-xrefactory

This version of yacc is build upon the Berkley Yacc 1.9 but with some
skeleton changes. The original ones can be found in
byacc.1.9.patch.txt.

However these sources are version managed and there have been some
additional changes. So be careful if you try to rebuild from the
original.
